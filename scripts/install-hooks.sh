#
# WHY LOCAL HOOKS MATTER HERE: GitHub Actions on this account is currently blocked
# ("recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased"),
# so every workflow run fails in ~5s having executed ZERO steps. A control that cannot
# run is not a control, so the local hooks are the compensating control until billing is
# restored. Re-verify with: gh run list -R <repo> --limit 3
#
#   pre-commit -> sanitize gate (fast; blocks a secret from ever entering a commit)
#   commit-msg -> sanitize gate over the commit MESSAGE (scripts/sanitize-text.sh): the
#                 tree gate never sees message text, and messages are history once pushed
#   pre-push   -> sanitize gate + unit tests + mutation check (the full gate set)
